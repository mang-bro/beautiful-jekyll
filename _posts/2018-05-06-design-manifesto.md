title: Design Manifesto
---

At the beginning of this semester I was thrilled to learn that my project had been chosen to be designed throughout the semester. This project eventually evolved into a2a, a mobile-based platform that is used to support a creative community here at Williams. Through the course of this semester, my team and I have experienced a user-focused design process from scratch to high-fidelity model. Throughout this process, several keys aspects have become pillars in my design process: affinity-diagramming, tasked-based design, heuristic evaluations, accessibility, and ethics. 

Before I dive into the rest of this manifesto, I must first discuss my prior design experience to fully explain how my perceptions about the design process have changed and grown because of this class. Last summer I had an internship in which I help an engineering team at Twitter build an internal tool for the company. My job on the team was to perform user research about the internal tool’s predecesor, design the user interface of the new internal tool, and iteratively user test the internal tool. During my time over the summer, I developed a concept of how the design-process should be, but it was not supported by theoretical readings about design, like this class. Thus, entering this class I wanted to be as flexible and open to changing my design process as possible, and the rest of this paper reveals how this class has helped my design process grow. 

The first design activity that really struck me during this semester was the affinity diagramming section. Beyer and Holzblatt summarize the stage of affinity diagramming well: “The affinity is the first consolidation step, and it teaches the thinking for all the rest.” After my team’s initial research and contextual inquiries, we needed a way to process the data we had gathered. Originally, I thought that compiling notes from contextual inquiries was the only way we could internalize the information we had obtained. The magic from affinity diagramming, however, is that it reveals common themes from the contextual inquiries, providing a higher level understanding of the contextual inquiries outside of individual cases themselves. In a2a’s case, we were able to identify a pain point in the the community at Williams: finding out about events at Williams was difficult because of multiple (and often unreliable) news sources, which was not even on our team’s radar for themes to focus on for the design. Fig. 1 shows the affinity grouping that identified this pain point.

Additionally, because I was performing this task with a team instead of just myself, we could easily check each other for biases. This additional layer revealed to me the importance of having multiple people involved in the design process. Although it is not always feasible to have a design team with multiple people, the design process feels most productive when there are multiple people involved. 

The second design activity that proved essential for the design of a2a was task-based design. Supported by scenarios and use cases, tasks became an excellent way for our team to systematically break down the design work needed for our platform. Because our platform’s main objective is to support a creative community, the details of what that design actual should entail felt very vague. Using insights gleaned from affinity diagramming, our team was able to construct realistic scenarios of how our app would be used and define and prioritize key tasks to concentrate on. Fig. 2 shows one of the scenarios we envisioned for the app.

This scenario is almost a direct design response to the theme that was identified by Fig. 1 in affinity diagramming: event discovery. Having concrete tasks to focus the design on was great for our team because it gave us direction, and we had robust data and analysis to justify why and what we were designing for. For us, scenarios and tasks were used for a basis for overall design and as a means of cooperation within our design team, two out of four roles scenarios can be used for identified by Bødker. 

One of the final stages of design before user testing is heuristic evaluations. Heuristic design is a great tool in general because it provides a systematic method for evaluating a design, and the process of evaluation is incredibly clear and thorough. It also catches design mistakes that can could be costly during user testing. For a2a, heuristic evaluations proved to be invaluable to our design. From just three heuristic evaluations, we were able to identify problems with our workflows because of missing back buttons (violation of User Control and Freedom), confusing wording (violation of Match between system and real world), and confusing use of icons (violation of consistency and standards).

Fig. 3 shows a side by side of the Upload Work workflow of our paper prototype, shown as before and after heuristic evaluations. The wording from the ‘Choose method’ menu was confusing, according to the heuristic evaluation, so we simplified the language to make the workflow as clear as possible. 

This class was one of the first times my ability privilege was attacked because I have never considered accessibility when designing a product. Thus, the accessibility readings for this class were rather enlightening and forced me to think about how disabled users can interact with interfaces. I really enjoyed our class about accessibility as well as the screen reading examples were both humorous and informational. Thinking about accessibility made our team think about our design process for a2a in a completely different angle. Because one of the main features of our product is being able to discovery and see visual art, visuals play a huge role in our app. Designing an app that is so highly saturated with visuals while taking into consideration sight disability has proven an interesting challenge for our team. So far, our team has not come up with a clear design solution for disabled users, but designing for full-accessibility has become a pillar in our design process. 

The final pillar to my design process that has emerged from this class is ethics. I have been exposed to many non-ethical ways technology has been used or manipulated, but reading these articles were incredibly infuriating they really shed light on how incredibly terrible the misuse of technology can be. My personal view of how technology should fit into society is that technology should only exist to make human life more efficient or more easy (hopefully achieving both at the same time). Too many times, however, I have seen technology that is created specifically to make money. This scenario can obviously lead to many ethical issues, as profit cannot be generated without some form of exploitation. I have also seen the case where technology is developed and is not rigorously tested and when product is launched into the real world, the errors end up being fatal. This scenario is most often caused by our society’s obsession with progress and ridiculous need for constant production. Half-baked products are a side-effect of this culture. Finally, I have seen the case where technology is developed for an original reason and spins out of control into a monster that the original founders did not intend. This is a clear example of making before critically thinking about the impacts a product could have. As an engineer and now designer, I promise in this design manifesto to never design a product for the sole purpose of profit, never to launch a product without rigorous testing, and to never produce a product before critically thinking about its potential impacts. 

The design process is a constantly evolving one. I came into this class with a fuzzy concept of what a design process should be, and honestly came out with more questions because there are so many different directions the design process can go! I am, however, more equipped now to tackle different design challenges with the array of tools that we have been introduced to in this course. From this semester, however, I have experienced the effectiveness of affinity diagramming, task-based design, and heuristic evaluations. These three processes will definitely have a strong influence on my future design process, but I am flexible for that to change. Accessibility and ethics, however, will become pillars in my design process. That will never change and this design manifesto is my promise to that.
