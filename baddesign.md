WILLIAMS COLLEGE BOOKSTORE

Having taken a couple architecture classes here, I know that procession is one of the main design principles when it comes to creating a space. Many times, the architects that Williams has chosen to design its buildings have disappointed me. However, none so much as the Williams Bookstore. On top of being aesthetically displeasing, the entire building feels like a total waste of space. As a person enters the bookstore, they are immediately greeted with the check out counter. Because the bookstore is the only supplier of textbooks on campus, this area tends to be incredibly crowded during the beginning and end of the semester. Because of the crowds, long lines tend to form in front of the counter. This is inconvenient for anyone trying to visit the shop at the time. Additionally, to get to any other part of the store (including upstairs), the counter must be passed. Therefore, the long lines during the crowded times are impossible to avoid if someone is trying to get to any other part of the store. On top of that, there is little sitting space, so few places students can work, and the double axes of the building feel entirely uneccessary. Double axes are usually used to split a space into distinct bodies, but in this case the only exist to confuse a visitor.
