COW SALT/PEPPER SHAKER

I went to this crazy antique store that recently opened up on Cole Ave. It's one of those pricier antique stores where the owner of the shop goes out and puts an effort to collect things. The shopkeeper then creates ways to display the pieces in visually appealing ways. I found this salt shaker near some old pieces of China and had no idea what it was originally because the the holes were in the back. Turning the salt shaker around, the use became apparent. This design stuck out to me, however, because the holes were not on the same vertical axis as the bottom of the shaker. Instead, it was on an axis perpendicular to the bottom of the shaker. The clever design is hard to describe, but by changing to the perpendicular axis one thing is changed. With normal salt shakers, when the shaker is turned upside down, an uncontrolled amount of salt falls out. To control the amount falling out with normal shakers, the shaker must be turned a varying level of degrees depending on how much salt is in the shaker. However, because the holes of this shaker are placed where they are, a user can turn the shaker 90 degrees and use their finger to tap out how much salt they want to come out, which is a lot more controlled. Additionally, the shaker shape is quite cute by itself.
