MOTIVATION

Williams campus has the potential to have a very vibrant creative community. However, currently there is no structure in place to facilitate this. Art (in any form: visual, musical, spoken word, etc.) has always been a very separate part of campus. Additionally, the different types of art have always felt very disparate (visual stays in the studio art building or art museums, music stays in the music department, etc.). It would be great to have a some sort of platform that can foster a creative community.

THE PRODUCT

I'm hoping to make a platform in which local artists (students, faculty, local residents, etc.) can interact with each other, and anyone in the community interested in art can discover. On this platform, artists should be able to display their works, advertise upcoming events, and discuss anything creative. The fun part of this platform would be the interactivity of all of it. Possible features could be commenting/discussing different pieces of art, discovering artists and reaching out for artistic collaborations, some kind of news forum, etc. The most important thing about this app is that it can create opportunities for artists to colloborate and share, as well as opportunities for anyone interested to interact with artists in their area!

SIMILAR WORKS

There is currently a mobile app called Trill (sample images in Fig. 1). It works as a local art discovery app, but only cater towards the discovery part. It does not really include a community space for any artists, but instead shows events and recent art made.
